# FINAL PROJECT

Hello! Thank you for viewing my final project for Computer Science II: Analyzing Data with Python.

This repository has all the files I used in creating this final project. Each of the CSV files represents one of the datasets I used. **The sources of the datasets are all listed on my final presentation and linked there**.

**readdata.py**: The Python script I wrote to analyze the files that I got from the internet
**readdata.html**: The HTML code generated by the Bokeh Python package to display the graphs that I generated.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback! The link/QR code to the feedback form is on my slideshow.

I hope you enjoy!
